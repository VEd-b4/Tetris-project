2. Open your terminal (Command Prompt or PowerShell).
3. Navigate to the folder containing the source code.
4. Compile the code using the following command (depending on your compiler):
    - If using MinGW (GCC):
      ```bash
      g++ -o tetris_game tetris_game.cpp
      ```
    - If using Visual Studio's MSVC:
      ```bash

      ```
